- When reducing capacity, remove spells that don't fit onto it anymore ***from back to front***
- Properly add inventory_slot.x when adding new spells

- Update functions for 1.0
- Add property to change whether wand recharges (mana recharge and cast recharge) only in hand
- Add function to serialize and deserialize wand to string? Hard with lots of spells...
- Add functio/overload to remove spells at certain positions
