- Add test for GetFreeSlotsCount()
- Add tests for deserialization when missing wand properties or sprites, weird properties (like negative capacities)
- Use GamePickUpInventoryItem( player_entity, item, false ) for PutnPlayersInventory? (Currently broken, plays pickup effect anyways)
- Add property to change whether wand recharges (mana recharge and cast recharge) only in hand
