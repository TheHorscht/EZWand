Rework split_string and GetSprite()
v1.2.2:
- GetSprite() now returns SpriteComponent:image_file if AbilityComponent:sprite_file is an empty string

v1.2.1:
- FIX Overwriting of init_total_prob caused by dofiling data/scripts/gun/procedural/gun_procedural.lua

v1.2.0:
- Added serialize function and add overload for constructor which takes a serialized string to build a wand out of it
- Added EZWand.Deserialize(serialized_string) which returns a table with the deserialized values without creating a new wand
- Change logic what constitutes a wand from having a ManaReloaderComponent to having an AbilityComponent with use_gun_script="1"

v1.1.3:
- FIX Wands thrown that were added to the inventory using PutInPlayersInventory() were not thrown correctly

v1.1.2:
- FIX reducing capacity not removing spells correctly

v1.1.1:
- FIX UpdateSprite throwing an error

v1.1.0:
- AddSpells() now places the spells at the next free position on the wand and sets their position correctly
- GetSpells() now returns the spells in the order the appear on the wand (if the order has been set)
- Added SetSprite() and GetSprite()
- Added RemoveSpellAtIndex()
- Added new syntax to AddSpells() for adding multiple spells.
- CHANGE: wand.shuffle needs to be boolean now instead of 0 or 1
- CHANGE: RemoveSpells now only removes one instance of a spell, if you want to remove all instances, pass in -1 as the amount
- FIX: PutInPlayersInventory not disabling/enabling the components correctly (wand keeps spinning in hand etc)
- FIX: Detaching spells increases capacity
- FIX: Constructor doesn't work when specifying entity_id number as string, e.g: EZWand("22")
